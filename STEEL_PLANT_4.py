# In a steel plant, the quality of steel is graded according to the following conditions:
# (i) Hardness must be greater than 50
# (ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7
# (iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600
# The grades are as follows:
# Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met
# Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
# Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
# Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
# Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
# Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met
# Construct a program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of
# the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.


#Take input from user
hardness = float(input("Enter hardness of steel: "))
carbon = float(input("Enter carbon content of steel: "))
tensile = float(input("Enter tensile strength of steel: "))

# Check conditions
cond1 = hardness > 50          # Condition (i)
cond2 = carbon < 0.7           # Condition (ii)
cond3 = tensile > 5600         # Condition (iii)

# Decide grade
if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
    grade = 10
elif cond1 and cond2:
    grade = 9
elif cond2 and cond3:
    grade = 8
elif cond1 and cond3:
    grade = 7
elif cond1 or cond2 or cond3:
    grade = 6
else:
    grade = 5

# Print result
